Project has been developed using AppGini, any issues you have with Installation and Configuration can likely be resolved via the AppGini docs:
https://bigprof.com/appgini/support

Install Guide: https://bigprof.com/appgini/help/working-with-generated-web-database-application/setup

The Project file (AXP File) can be edited via AppGini. 

At this stage, no custom code has been added however I will likely be adding in the future:
- Reporting
- Email Notifications
- UI Modifications
